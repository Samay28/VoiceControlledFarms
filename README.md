# Fast-Paced Farming Simulator: Voice-Controlled & Gesture-Based Learning Game

## **Abstract** 📜📑
A voice-controlled and gesture-based farming simulator designed for **interactive learning and skill development**. Players manage 4 plots of farmland over 30-minute sessions, aiming to maximize revenue through strategic decisions influenced by **real-world farming scenarios**. Voice commands, AI-driven personalization, and gesture controls using **face and head movements** enhance **inclusivity, accessibility**, and immersive gameplay.

## **Problem We Aim to Solve** 🔨🧾⚙
Traditional learning lacks **engagement, accessibility, and practical application**. This game aims to:
- **Skill Development**: Enhance decision-making, resource management, and strategic thinking.
- **Inclusive Learning**: Provide accessible controls for users of all abilities through voice and gesture inputs.
- **Vocational Skill Training**: Create scenarios that simulate real-world skills like farming, economics, and risk management.

## **Core Gameplay Concept** 🌾🚜
- **Objective**: Players manage 4 plots of land, using strategies to maximize earnings in 30-minute sessions (10-15 harvests).
- **Dynamic Starting Conditions**: Begin with fixed capital, randomized seasons (e.g., summer, winter) affecting crop choice and success rates.

## **Major Features & Player Choices**  🕹🎮🖱
1. **Plot Management**: 
   - Decide the number of plots to plant; more plots mean higher potential revenue but increased costs.
2. **Crops & Harvesting**: 
   - Each crop has specific attributes: price, seasonal suitability, and time to harvest.
   - Players must balance crop choices based on seasonal success rates and market demands (e.g., wheat thrives in summer but not in winter).
3. **Equipment, Fertilizer, & Irrigation**:
   - Choose equipment quality (Basic, Standard, Premium) for faster planting/harvesting.
   - Use fertilizers to boost yield (10-25%) but at an additional cost.
   - Select irrigation options to enhance crop growth during non-ideal seasons.
4. **Pest Control & Storage**: 
   - Pest control minimizes crop loss risk, adding a cost layer.
   - Store harvested crops to sell at better prices, considering storage costs and spoilage risks.
5. **Market Dynamics & Price Fluctuation**: 
   - Market prices vary after each harvest based on demand and supply.
   - Players must decide to sell immediately or hold for price surges.
6. **Random Events & Adaptive Challenges**: 
   - Encounter weather events, pest infestations, or market crashes/surges that affect crop success and prices.
   - AI adapts difficulty based on player progress to maintain an engaging challenge.

## **Technology Used** ⚙⚔🔈
- **Development Tools**:  
  - *Unreal Engine, Unity*: For 3D environments, plot management, and dynamic gameplay.
- **Control Systems**:  
  - *Voice Recognition & Gesture Controls*: Voice commands for in-game actions, face/head gestures for an immersive experience.
- **AI & Market Simulation**:  
  - *C++, C#, Python*: Drive AI behaviors, market price fluctuations, crop success rates, and player progress tracking.

## **Balancing Decisions & Tactics-Based Gameplay** ⚖️🎯
- Every action (plot management, crop selection, equipment, pest control) comes with **trade-offs** in cost, risk, and rewards.
- Encourages players to **experiment with combinations** to discover the most profitable strategies.

## **Future Plans** 🎧📸📍
- **AI Personalization Enhancements**: Further personalize gameplay through dynamic challenges, adapting to each player’s skill level and strategy.
- **Expanded Vocational Modules**: Introduce additional skill-based scenarios, e.g., carpentry, healthcare, to broaden learning experiences.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Broaden control schemes for different player abilities, such as keyboard/touch for those unable to use voice/gesture controls.
- **Gamified Assessments & Certifications**: Implement in-game assessments to track skill progression and certify accomplishments.
